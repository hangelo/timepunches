# timepunches

## Instructions

The software load three files: location, user and time punches.

The idea is to create a page where we can query all time punches of one selected user, also the total of workday, wage, etc.

The software can be upgraded by better coding some sections. I tried to demonstrate the use of objects, arrays, javascript requests, date and time methods, etc.

ALl works on the same file, we just manipulate the GET request to show only time punches or the list of users to be selected.
